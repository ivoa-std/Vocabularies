This is the bridge between the UAT and IVOA vocabularies.

The basic interest is:

* have IVOA-compatible URIs for UAT concepts; most importantly, we want
  readable concept URIs (BlackHole rather than 120)
* maintain format guarantees (e.g., offer a desise file)

The uat.skos file in here, although under version control, is *not* to
be changed or managed.  It is always generated from upstream UAT using
the uat2ivo.py script present here.

The actual conversion needs rapper installed.

To let us do emergency fixes for things that are problematic for us but
that cannot (easily) be fixed upstream, there is an EXTRA_TRIPLES dict
in uat2ivo.py.  Use it sparingly.

Here's what we're using EXTRA_TRIPLES for so far:

(a) In the early history of the UAT, some duplicate labels were given.
This would kill us here, since we generate the IVOA concept ids from
the labels.  To fix this, we override these labels (which all belong
to deprecated concepts).


Updating the UAT
----------------

When there is a new upstream release:

(0) check out git@github.com:ivoa-std/Vocabularies.git, go to the uat
    directory.

(1) run ``python uat2ivo.py``  This will pull the UAT's SKOS source from
    github, match it with the IVOA side and create new records in the
    local uat.skos.

(2) review the output (i.e., the new mappings)

(3) if all is fine, go one up and say ``python3 convert.py uat``; this
    is going to throw warnings from skosify but should otherwise work
    fine.

(4) now follow the usual vocabulary update procedures.
