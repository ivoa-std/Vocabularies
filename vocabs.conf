timestamp: 2022-04-22
title: Roles of dates
description: This vocabulary enumerates roles of dates in the evolution
	of VO resources for use in VOResource's curation/date/@role attribute.
	Most of these terms are taken from the dateType
	enumeration in the DataCite metadata kernel.

path: voresource/relationship_type
timestamp: 2016-08-17
title: Relationship types in the VO
description: This vocabulary enumerates the kinds of relationships
	between VO resources that can be relevant in discovery or maintenance.
	Many of the terms are taken from the relationType enumeration in
	the DataCite metadata kernel.  Operationally important concepts
	missing there (e.g., served-by) were drawn from VOResource 1.0.
authors: Plante, R.; Demleitner, M.

[timescale]
flavour: RDF Class
timestamp:2019-03-15

[refframe]
flavour: RDF Class
timestamp:2022-02-22
title:Reference Frames
description:A collection of reference frames in common use in astronomy,
	organised by top-level categories (equatorial, galactic, etc).  These
	concepts are used in VOTable's COOSYS, in SimpleDALRegExt's PosParam
	type, and of course in the Coords data model.  Where no more precise
	reference are given, http://www.iaufs.org/res.html is often of help.

[datalink]
flavour:RDF Property
timestamp: 2022-01-27
title: Datalink core
description: Terms in this vocabulary relate (abstract) datasets to
	files or other electronic artefacts, giving the relation between the two.
	They are originally intended for use in the semantics column in the output
	from the DataLink-1.0 {links} capability.  As specified in DataLink-1.0,
	terms from this vocabulary are used in the semantics column of {links}
	output output using only the identifier prefixed with a hash (i.e., "#word").

[product-type]
flavour: SKOS CSV
timestamp:2021-11-18
title: Data Product Type
description: This vocabulary gives a high level classification
	for data products in astronomy.  It is derived from a word list used by
	obscore to facilitate by-product discovery (“find spectra”) and is intended
	to cover similar use cases elsewhere (e.g., “find services serving spectra”
	in Registry).  A related use case this is supposed to cover is “route data
	products to applications that can handle them.”
