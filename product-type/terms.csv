spatially-resolved-dataset;1;Spatially Resolved;A dataset that has one or more spatial axes. This term is mainly intended for retrieval.  To annotate datasets, use a narrower term.
image;2;Image;An astronomical image with exactly two spatial axes. The image content may be complex.  For instance, an objective-prism observation would be considered a type of image, even though an extracted spectrum would be a spectrum data product.
cube;2;Cube;A multidimensional astronomical image with 3 or more axes, e.g., a spectral image cube, a polarization cube, a full Stokes radio data cube, a time image cube.
spectral-cube;3;Spectral Cube;A 3-dimensional astronomical image with two spatial  and one spectral axis.;skos:broader(spatially-resolved-dataset) skos:broader(spectrally-resolved-dataset)
time-cube;3;Time Cube;A 3-dimensional astronomical image with two spatial  and one temporal axis.;skos:broader(spatially-resolved-dataset) skos:broader(temporally-resolved-dataset)
polarization-cube;3;Polarization Cube;A 3-dimensional astronomical image with two spatial  and one polarization axis.;skos:broader(spatially-resolved-dataset) skos:broader(polarization-resolved-dataset)
polarization-resolved-dataset;1;Polarization Resolved;Sets of fluxes for different polarization states.  This term is mainly intended for retrieval.  To annotate datasets, use a narrower term.
spectrally-resolved-dataset;1;Spectrally Resolved;A dataset that has a spectral axis. This term is mainly intended for retrieval.  To annotate datasets, use a narrower term.
spectrum;2;Spectrum;Flux or magnitude as a function of a spectral coordinate.
sed;3;SED;"A spectral energy distribution, i.e., a set of calibrated fluxes over a typically wide part of the spectrum.  An SED is usually produced by combining data from multiple observations."
slit-spectrum;2;Slit Spectrum;Spectral measurements along a slit in space, organized as a set of successive spectra along the slit.;skos:broader(spatially-resolved-dataset)
polarized-spectrum;2;Polarization Spectrum;Fluxes or magnitudes given as a function of a spectral coordinate and a polarization state.;skos:broader(polarization-resolved-dataset)
dynamic-spectrum;2;Dynamic Spectrum;Consecutive spectral measurements through time,organized as a sequence of successive spectra;skos:broader(temporally-resolved-dataset)
visibility;1;Visibility;An interferometric radio observation given in Fourier space.
temporally-resolved-dataset;1;Temporally Resolved;A dataset with a time axis.  This term is mainly intended for retrieval.  To annotate datasets, use a narrower term.
event;2;Event;A collection of some sort of observed events, such as high-energy particles observed.  A row in an event list is typically characterised by spatial, spectral, and time information.
timeseries;2;Time Series;One or a few scalar observables as a function of time.  Prefer narrower terms if there is one for your observable(s).
light-curve;3;Light Curve;Flux or magnitude as a function of time;skos:broader(temporally-resolved-dataset)
velocity-curve;3;Velocity Curve;Radial velocities or redshifts as a function of time;skos:broader(temporally-resolved-dataset)
measurements;1;Measurements;  Generic tabular data not fitting any of the other terms.  For instance, a list of sources extracted from an image might be a measurement.  Because of its lack of specificity, this term should generally be avoided, and new, more precise terms should be introduced instead.
